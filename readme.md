# Melody
An [Ohm](https://github.com/harc/ohm) grammar for live coding music. It aims to have a simple and terse syntax while maintaining basic control structures and abstractions. The end goal is to be able to hook the semantics into a REPL that plays music based on the Melody program using the Web Audio API.
